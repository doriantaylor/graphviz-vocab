# GraphViz::Vocab

`graphviz-vocab` is a simple command-line program that will consume
the source documents for [GraphViz](https://www.graphviz.org/)
[types](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/raw/master/doc/infosrc/types)
and
[attributes](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/raw/master/doc/infosrc/attrs)
to generate an OWL ontology, and from that a sitelet which is equal
parts an enhancement of the associated documentation, and tech demo.

## Installation

This is a single-purpose program, structured as a Ruby Gem for my own
convenience. If, however, you want to install it via `gem install
graphviz-vocab`, there's nothing preventing you.
